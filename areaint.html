  <h1>Areas of Academic Interest</h1>
  <p>Below are my areas of interest in literature and my philosophies regarding each.</p>
  <h2>Queer Literature</h2>
  <p>With "queer literature," I mean literature that uses LGBT people and concepts as its core. "Queer," itself is a difficult term because of the multiple meanings it has for different people. In this case, I am using it as an encompassing term of the identities under the "spectrum" (Though I detest spectrum). My philosophy regarding queer identity is not for the sake of giving something a label, but identifying and analyzing characteristics associated with the queer. My goal isn't to force a narrative but to present an alternative.

  <h2>Young Adult Literature</h2>
  <p>In my graduate studies, I have found my interests leaning toward the not commonly studied, the "non-canonical" (That's a discussion for another day). My interest in young adult literature lies with subject areas being presented in a different manner than found in our traditional studies (Such as LGBT literature). I am interested in how underrepresented groups are viewed across the genre as well as the potential for challenging traditional representations found otherwise in historical works.
  </p>
  <h2>Video Game Studies</h2>
  <p>Much like with young adult literature, I am interested in the not as oft studied. In the realm of video games, I am interested in the ways games tell stories as well as how players perceive these stories. I am also interest in how the spaces within games are defined as well as the presence of pedagogical elements, such as scaffolding. As an example of the space of the game, I may look at <i>Gone Home's</i> atmosphere and use of lighting, sounds, and object interactivity to create a narrative that elicits forboding and mystery for the player. With games studies, I would look at what a game claims to do (Or what we claim it to do) and how it accomplishes that.
