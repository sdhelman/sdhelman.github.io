<h1>A Visual Approach to Text for ENGL121</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This pedagogical intervention makes use of the Voyant tool to create textual visualizations to spur further questions into our understandings of older texts. This particular intervention focuses on using the Voyant tool to analyze texts in an undergraduate literature elective context. Particularly within IUP's ENGL121 Humanities Literature course. This particular project would have students looking at the works, <i>Villette</i> by Charlotte Bronte, <i>Wuthering Heights</i> by Emily Bronte, and <i>Agnes Grey</i> by Anne Bronte. Prior to this assignment, students would have been formed into three reading groups and tasked with reading and discussing one of the three selected Bronte works (Obtainable primarily through Project Gutenburg or purchase depending on student preference). This particular lesson will have taken place the second week of Bronte study in the course. First, I'll address my overall goals with this series of lessons.
</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<ol><li>Students will navigate Voyant and manipulate its tools to define and assess data based on their uploaded texts.</li>
<li>Students will be able to use this data to make a determination about their text and comment on the stylistic and/or diction elements pertaining to each Bronte sister.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Process</h2>
<p>This project will take place over the course of two days and will require students to bring in laptops. If laptops aren't available, the instructor manages to accrue spare technology in his time and will loan for the day. The first day will be dedicated to working with the tools in Voyant and having students take note on their findings. I would first start by providing students a "clean" version of each novel on whichever learning platform I use (Most likely a raw HTML document uploaded onto github) and show them how to upload the text into Voyant. Then I would demo each tool and how to use the stopwords as well as what to put on there. I would also demonstrate how to export and save visualizations. After basic demonstration, I would give students their instructions and specifically what to look for based on discussions from the previous week and allow them to work in their groups to manipulate the tools. They would use their findings to complete a short homework assignment asking them to go back into the text with their data and determine the significance of that data to a particular scene, section, or other selection. The second day would use that in small group discussion and then a brief report to the class with final commentary from the instructor.
 </p>
 <h2>Rationale</h2>
 The overarching goal with this is showing how technology can be used to provide a different type of reading experience and also create a dataset that can be used to provide an assessment of the work. Instead of working scene by scene, students are working word by word.
