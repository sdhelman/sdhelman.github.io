<h1>S. D. Helman's Professional Page</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
 <p>Hello, I'm Sean Daniel Helman or S. D. Helman, but you may call me Sean or Dan (I acknowledge both). As of this posting, I am currently a graduate student at Indiana University of Pennsylvania pursuing a Master of Arts in English Composition and Literature. I am also applying to the PhD program in Literature & Criticism at IUP. My academic interests include queer literature, video games studies, and young adult literature (Primarily dystopian) In my spare time, I read leisurely, enjoy a relaxing drive, and play video games. I currently reside at the bottom of Westmoreland County and particularly enjoy the rolling hills and forest patches of the area while being in the foothills.</p>
