 <h1>A Brief and Technical Look at Henry James</h1?
  <p>I chose to examine Henry James through quantitative analysis  because he regarded as a highly descriptive author, fitting of his compatriots in the gilded era of the American novel. My own experience with James has been sorting through long, thick, wordy sentences that convey much thought at much quantity. With this visualization project, I can look and see just how complex James can get, particularly in his novels, which can typically run multiple volumes. The largest issue, thoughm, was selecting a corpus. Because of the nature of multi-volume works, one would need to effectively combine works together. I had opted, instead, to look at his shorter novels (Which are short by Henry James standards) and two novellas.</p>
 <p>I examined the following works:
 <ul><li><i>The American</i> published in 1877</li>
  <li>"Daisy Miller" published in 1878</li>
  <li><i>The Europeans</i> published in 1878</li>
  <li>"Turn of the Screw" published in 1898</li>
  <li><i>The Ambassadors</i> published in 1903</li></ul>
 <br>Works were procured from Project Gutenberg of the US (To distinguish from PG Canada and PG Australia which allow users to access more recent works given that copyright laws of the latter two countries are different) and scurbbed of technical information inserted into the plain text. The Voyant-Tools stop list was also used to scrub out prominent character names, titles, and "said," which is a common feature of the novel.</p>
 <p>The first widget (Embedded here) I looked at was the summary tool.
