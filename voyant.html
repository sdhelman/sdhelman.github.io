 <h1>A Brief and Technical Look at Henry James</h1>
  <p>I chose to examine Henry James through quantitative analysis  because he regarded as a highly descriptive author, fitting of his compatriots in the gilded era of the American novel. My own experience with James has been sorting through long, thick, wordy sentences that convey much thought at much quantity. With this visualization project, I can look and see just how complex James can get, particularly in his novels, which can typically run multiple volumes. The largest issue, thoughm, was selecting a corpus. Because of the nature of multi-volume works, one would need to effectively combine works together. I had opted, instead, to look at his shorter novels (Which are short by Henry James standards) and two novellas.</p>
 <p>I examined the following works:
 <ul><li><i>The American</i> published in 1877</li>
  <li>"Daisy Miller" published in 1878</li>
  <li><i>The Europeans</i> published in 1878</li>
  <li>"Turn of the Screw" published in 1898</li>
  <li><i>The Ambassadors</i> published in 1903</li></ul>
 <br>Works were procured from Project Gutenberg of the US (To distinguish from PG Canada and PG Australia which allow users to access more recent works given that copyright laws of the latter two countries are different) and scurbbed of technical information inserted into the plain text. The Voyant-Tools stop list was also used to scrub out prominent character names, titles, and "said," which is a common feature of the novel.</p>
 <p>The first widget (Embedded here) I looked at was the summary tool.

<br> Looking at this view raises an interesting point. The Ambassadors has the higest word count of the five, but the lowest vocabulary density. Daisy Miller has the highest vocabulary density but lowest word count. It raises the question of perhaps what sorts of descriptions James is using or if the timing of the release affected this statistic. The distinctive words category is a bit moot since it mainly focuses on character names, of which James uses frequently. He was very much a novelist of character design and interaction.</p>
<p>The next widget looks at the top 5 most common words in Daisy Miller as their frequency across the novella. I will note that "don't" is on my stoplist, but will still show itself here given that Voyant is still being updated actively.

 <br>You'll see the top four used relatively evenly, but then the top word, "young," starts off at high usage before dropping into line with the rest of the word count. However, James's vocabulary is fixated on "young girl" because of his use of Winterbourne's obsessive descritpion of Daisy. If I were not to have read this novella, I would make the assumption of the novella's content based upon the counts. This next widget looks at the terms used throughout DM and their frequencies.
 <br>UPDATE 3/29/18 11:21pm Apparently the widget showing frequent word use in Voyant defaulted to showing all five limbs of the corpus. I will fix this ASAP. Thank you for your understanding...

 <br>With this listing, we can see the unique word usage across the novella and their frequencies.</p>
 <p>It brings an interesting light to the different works of James and what is contained within as well as how it's used. I actually had to cut my research short because of technical difficulties with Voyant's widgets. However, based on this close analysis of Daisy Miller, one could call into question the claim that Henry James is a heavily descriptive writer, but that's where we as humanists step in to read and understand the works. My speculation as well is that this was the beginning of his career and perhaps motivation saw fit. If I were to upload James's multivolume works, I may draw similar conclusions. Of course, it seems that his novels as a whole lack in comparison to his novellas in word uniqueness Granted, I am also looking more broadly as opposed to a specific item of language use. I would say that the goal of this quantative analysis is to look for trends across massive volumes of text, rather than the close reading of five singular items. Perhaps I would also compare James against his fellow Gilded era writers and determine where he excels and lacks compared to others. My rationale here was to look at a variety of works, though I concentrated on a couple year span with one outlier. Perhaps one could look at a 2-3 year span and see if James is consistent across that space, rather than across his career.</p>
